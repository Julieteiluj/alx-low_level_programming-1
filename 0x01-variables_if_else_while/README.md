1. The 0-positive_or_negative.c source code will print of a random number generated at the start of the program is zero, greater or less than zero.

2. The 1-last_digit.c source code will print the last number of a generated random number.

3. The 2-print_alphabet.c source code prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line with a printchar function.

4. The 3-print_alphabets.c source code prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line using the putchar function.

5. The 4-print_alphabt.c source code prints the alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters p and q using the putchar function.

6. The 5-print_numbers.c source code prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

7. The 6-print_numberz.c source code prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line, using no variable of type char and only printing with the putchar function.

8. The 7-print_tebahpla.c source code prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line using the putchar function.

9. The 8-print_base16.c source code prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line using the putchar function.

10. The 9-print_comb.c source code prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers each followed separated by commas using the pitchar function.

11. The 100-print_comb3.c source code prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
    Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space
    The two digits must be different
01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1
    Print only the smallest combination of two digits
    Numbers should be printed in ascending order, with two digits
    You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etcâ€¦) is forbidden)
You can only use putchar five times maximum in your code
    You are not allowed to use any variable of type char.

12. The 101-print_comb4.c source code prints all possible different combinations of three digits.  Similar to that of 11.

13. The 102-print_comb5.c prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
